"""Build scaling relations (Relation) from adsorption energy (Eads).

The following would take CO2 reduction to CH4 reaction (CO2RR) as an example.

The traditional method:
    As proposed in Peterson and NÃ¸rskov's work titled *Activity Descriptors for
    CO2 Electroreduction to Methane on Transition-Metal Catalysts*, involves
    grouping species involved in the CO2RR process into two categories:
    C-centered (*COOH, *CO, *CHO, *CH2O) and O-centered (*OCH3, *O, *OH).

    Within each group, a descriptor is nominated (in the original work, it was
    *CO and *OH respectively). The adsorption energies of other species can
    then be approximated by their respective descriptor, effectively reducing
    the dimensionality of the problem from 7D to 2D.
    This reduction enables visualization and simplifies the analysis process.

The hybrid method:
    As discussed in my MPhil work (at https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03876),
    recognizes that many species involved in the process include both oxygen
    and carbon. Therefore, it makes sense to include descriptors for both
    elements in the relation. In that work, I discovered that this simple
    approach can improve the coefficient of determination (R2) by
    approximately 0.06-0.13, thus confirming its validity.

    Moreover, this method doesn't incur significant costs:
        - Confirming the descriptor ratio requires only few linear regressions.
        - Users are not required to specify the descriptor,
            though they have the option to do so.
        - The resulting Relation is compatible with the traditional method.

        How this builder works:
            1. Composite descriptor construction:
            First a composite descriptor is constructed for actual linear
            regression process. For example there may be two nominated
            descriptors (each as a np.ndarray) and their mixing ratios
            (for example [0.2, 0.8]). Then the composite descriptor is
            constructed as:
                comp_descriptor = 0.2 * descriptor_A + 0.8 * descriptor_B

            2. Linear regressions:
            The composite descriptor would be used to perform linear
            regressions with each adsorbate. For each adsorbate, there
            would be a coefficient, an intercept and a metrics score:
                coef, intercept, score = LinearRegression(*)

            3. Map scaling coefficients to original descriptors:
            As the linear regression is construction upon the composite
            descriptor, we need to map the scaling parameters to
            the origin descriptors, which is straightforward:
                Multiple the coefficients with corresponding ratios,
                and leave the intercept unchanged.
